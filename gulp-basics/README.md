# Gulp Basics Treehouse Course
This repository contains the project code for my [Gulp Basics course on Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/gulp-basics).

## Using this Repo
This is a node project.  On the master branch is the "final" version of our app.  Each video has a corresponding branch and you can run `git checkout <some-video>` to follow along.  Instruction's are in the Teacher's Notes with each video.

## Quick Start
```
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/hdngr/treehouse-gulp-basics.git
# Navigate into the directory
cd treehouse-gulp-basics
# Install the project's node dependencies
npm install
# Checkout the branch for the video you want to follow along with
git checkout <some-video>
```

## Installing gulp and http server
This course requires you to have global installations of [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

```
# Install gulp globally
npm install -g gulp
# Install http-server globally
npm install -g http-server
```
